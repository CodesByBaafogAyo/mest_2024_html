    <h2>A short poem to let off some steam</h2>
    <div>   
        <!-- This is a poem -->
        <p id>
        I thought he loved me. <br>
        I thought he wanted me.<br>
        I thought he thought me to be the best thing that has ever happened to him, perhaps because he said so.<br>
        I thought him to be the perfect gift, that came at the nick of time, perhaps i held on to just thin air.<br>
        <br>
        He said he loved me.
        He said he cherished me.
        He said he will never leave me.
        He promised me <em>together forever </em>
        <br>
        I can still remember how looks at me.<br>
        How he trys to fit his fingers inbetween mine.<br>
        How he carried me and makes me feel like some spoilt little girl.<br>
        How it's very late in the night and we dont wanna say goodbyes.<br>
        <br>
        Now he doesnt even call.<br>
        He barely leave me messages.<br>
        He almost doesngt respond to mine.<br>
        I feel like i have lost him forever but he was never mine to begin with.<br>
        <br>
        I have been fooled! i was my own fool! Perhaps there is really nothing called LOVE!!! <br>

        <p>felt very special
            and  before the night was over, i gave in<br>
            I kissed him!!!!<br>
            <br>
            Did i mention that i  haven't kissed anyone in over 3years<br>
            and i just let it go after battling with the thought that perhaps it wasnt really  worth it.<br>
            <br>
            Yes.... The KISS!!!<br>
            My head was spinning<br>
            My  heart skipping several beats<br>
            My legs failing from below me.<br>
            I was at the 7th  heaven!!!!
            <br>
            It was certainly  better that i thought it will be. He was an amazing kisser!
            <br>
            Hmmmmmm!
